The time complexity for search/insert would be log base 2 (10000) = 13.29. This means, that in the worse case it would take 13.29 steps/comparisons to find or inset an element if the tree is perfectly balanced. Or best case it would be log base 3(10000) = 8.383 comparisons. As this data set is larger, the time complexity for it is most likely larger. 
In my code a used a RedBlackTree, this data set maintains balance by using a set of rules or color properties to ensure of this. These rules make sure the tree maintains its hight in the rang of x(log n).
